# SymfonyShop
This is a straightforward shop that displays a list of products and their prices in a One-to-One relationship, styled with Bootstrap. I have implemented an admin account with the capability to add, edit, and delete products, while regular users do not have such privileges. The shop features a login and registration panel.

Additionally, I made a delivery email test using a queue via Messenger.
